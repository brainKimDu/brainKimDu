### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm brainKimDu, a robotics enthusiast and experienced ROS engineer with a passion for developing AI robotic solutions.

As a ROS engineer, I've worked on a variety of projects spanning from autonomous navigation to object recognition, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges in this exciting field. I have extensive experience with both the software and hardware aspects of robotics, including ROS, Gazebo, and a variety of sensors and actuators.

I'm always up for a good adventure and am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge with others Through my Blog

  <br> I have a ability to translate requirements into programming logic using C++ and Python. However, when it comes to delving deep into algorithms and considering memory efficiency and time complexity, I still have room to grow. While I may not yet be an expert in these areas, I'm enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge and skills to develop more efficient and effective solutions.

  <b> , Matplotlib etc, EDA, Machine Learning </b>
  <br> While my theoretical knowledge of machine learning and image processing may not be extensive, I have a basic understanding of the concepts and how they can be applied to real-world problems. In addition, I have hands-on experience working with open-source tools like YOLO and SLAM.

Similarly, while I may not have memorized every command in Pandas, I understand how to manipulate data and am confident in my ability to analyze it. With a combination of my knowledge and the power of online search, I'm confident that I can excel in data analysis and stand out from the rest.

  <b> , Deep_Learning </b>
  <br> When it comes to deep learning, I excel at working with open-source tools like YOLO and MediaPipe etc. However, I am not able to analyze models with untraceable processes. While I may not have a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms, I am confident in my ability to use these tools effectively to solve real-world problems. As I continue to grow and develop my skills, I am excited to learn more about the theoretical aspects of deep learning and further enhance my expertise.
