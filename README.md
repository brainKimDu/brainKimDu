### Hi there 👋
I'm brainKimDu, a robotics enthusiast and experienced ROS engineer with a passion for developing AI robotic solutions.

As a ROS engineer, I've worked on a variety of projects spanning from autonomous navigation to object recognition, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges in this exciting field. I have extensive experience with both the software and hardware aspects of robotics, including ROS, Gazebo, and a variety of sensors and actuators.

I'm always up for a good adventure and am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge with others Through my Blog

If you're interested in learning more about my work, feel free to check out my GitHub profile and portfolio. I'm always happy to connect with fellow robotics enthusiasts and collaborate on exciting new projects!

  <br> I have a strong ability to translate requirements into programming logic using C++ and Python. However, when it comes to delving deep into algorithms and considering memory efficiency and time complexity, I still have room to grow. While I may not yet be an expert in these areas, I'm enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge and skills to develop more efficient and effective solutions.

  <b>Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04 </b>
  <br> Since I do all of my work on Ubuntu, I find it much more convenient to work with Ubuntu than other operating systems.

  <b> , Matplotlib etc, EDA, Machine Learning </b>
  <br> While my theoretical knowledge of machine learning and image processing may not be extensive, I have a basic understanding of the concepts and how they can be applied to real-world problems. In addition, I have hands-on experience working with open-source tools like YOLO and SLAM.

Similarly, while I may not have memorized every command in Pandas, I understand how to manipulate data and am confident in my ability to analyze it. With a combination of my knowledge and the power of online search, I'm confident that I can excel in data analysis and stand out from the rest.

  <b> , UML, </b> <b> System Architecture, MLOps </b>
  <br> I understanded Object oriented programming Through JAVA, recently I interested in Software Design so Learning it.
  <br> Also experienced Android Studio Using JAVA.

  <b> , Deep_Learning </b>
  <br> When it comes to deep learning, I excel at working with open-source tools like YOLO and MediaPipe etc. However, I am not able to analyze models with untraceable processes. While I may not have a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms, I am confident in my ability to use these tools effectively to solve real-world problems. As I continue to grow and develop my skills, I am excited to learn more about the theoretical aspects of deep learning and further enhance my expertise.
